ESP8266 APA102 POV poi example code 
    ...that i plan to use on a arduino nano.
    And i'll try with ws2812 because that's what i've got.
    It turns out these are a bit slow when it comes to refresh rate, so you get a somewhat "pixely" effect. 
    Anyway, just with the RGBSetDemo these things look pretty awesome, displaying some text should be possible.
    No fancy circuits, i'd like to try a strip of 32 pixels, folded in half so we get 16px, powered directly by the arduino nano, connected to a 1 cell usb 
    powerbank. As easy as it gets, hopefully just plug and play, we'll see. :)
         A bit of soldering is needed though to connect the leds. 

This is part of a much larger POV poi project using Spiffs, Wifi, Android and PC code to create a fully featured open source poi.
 at some point I hope to clean the code up enough to share. In the meantime, try this working snippet. 
    
   
   
  make sure to visit toms website and github, there's tons of other stuff, i'm waiting for 2 wemos d1 minis to try these too!
